h2 Including
p You can either include the grid by using the grid.scss, example:
code @import "grid.scss";
p  ... or by importing all partials by them self (this is what grid.scss does), example:
code
  | @import "grid_partials/grid-variables.scss";
  | @import "grid_partials/grid-mixins.scss";
  | @import "grid_partials/grid-engine.scss";
h2 Variables
p U can setup the variables anyway you like. This is useful to change support for other systems like bootstrap. Or if you want to add more breakpoints.
h3 Example of grid-variables.scss:
code
  | $grid-prefix: ''; // Example: set 'grid-' to make wrapper, row and columns grid-*
  | $grid-col-name: 'col';
  | $grid-row-name: 'row';
  | $grid-wrapper-name: 'wrapper';
  | 
  | $grid-columns: 12;
  | $grid-max-width: 65em;
  | $grid-col-padding: 1em;
  | 
  | $grid-breakpoints: (
  |     ('xs', 0px),
  |     ('sm', 768px),
  |     ('md', 992px),
  |     ('lg', 1200px)
  | );
